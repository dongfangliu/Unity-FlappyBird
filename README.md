# FlappyBird-A beautiful world

#### Background

FlappyBird flapped and flapped, gradually, it feels tired……

With no more players that  are willing to flap him again, he is  so sad....

At this time, he entered a new world with delicious fruits!

He flapped and took one.Surprisingly, he gets <u>new skills</u>! Life becomes easier and he is no longer thirsty again.

He feels great to continue his journey!![GameStart](READMEfile/GameStart.PNG)

#### How to Play?

Open ```builds```folder, choose ```exe``` or```apk``` for your platform.

Another choice is to download all the files and build it with your Unity.

I provided 4 kinds of fruits. They have the following surprises from left to right:

- ***One More Score*** when passing a column.
- ***HeroMode!*** SpeedUp and break the columns forword!
- ***Be invisible.*** You can just pass through all the columns, viewing them as not existing!!!
- ***SmallerSize!*** Owning a smaller Size to easily passing through a column.

#### Skill Effect Preview

#### Note:

1. ***The Fruit has a lifetime which means if you don't take it in time , it will fade and disapper.***
2. ***All the skill effects will be removed when the label in the left circle fades.***
3. ***A friendly ticking time will remind you that skilltime is almost 0.***
